Why Algorithm.
1. Gives an idea of running time of program.
2. Helps us to decide on hardware requirments
3. Breaking the problem and distribute on multiple devices
4. What is feasible vs what is impossible
5. Improvement of current program 
6. Allows us to keep improve. 


Why Data structure :
1. 


Correctness of an algorithm
1. statement to be proven 
2. List all assumptions
3. Chain of reasoning from assuptions to statement.
