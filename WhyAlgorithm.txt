Why Algorithm.
1. Gives an idea of running time of program.
2. Helps us to decide on hardware requirments
3. Breaking the problem and distribute on multiple devices
4. What is feasible vs what is impossible
5. Improvement of current program 
6. Allows us to keep improve. 


Why Data structure :
1. 


Correctness of an algorithm
1. statement to be proven 
2. List all assumptions
3. Chain of reasoning from assuptions to statement.

Incorrectness of an Algorithm. 
Step 1 : Give a set of data for which the algorithm does not work 
Step 2 : Usually consider small data sets 
step 3 : Especially consider borderline cases. 

Analysis of algorithms 
Two types of consideration 
1. How much time it will take to run algorithm
2. HOw much space it will take to run algorithm

1. Space complexity and 2. Time complexity

Linear Growth of time
Quadratic growth time

Types of time time complexity
3-types
1. worst case
2. best case
3. average case

RAM model of computation 
1. Assume we have infintie memory
2. Each operation (+-*/) takes unit time of ONe.
3. For each memory access, unit time is consumed
4. Data may be accessed from Ram or disk, it is assumed that data is in the RAM.
